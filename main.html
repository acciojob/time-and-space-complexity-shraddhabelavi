	<h1>Time and Space and complexity</h1>
	<p>Time define any physical object in the Universe. Similarly, Space and Time complexity can define the effectiveness of an algorithm. </p>
	<p>O(n) <strong>space complexity </strong>means that the amount of memory required by the algorithm grows linearly with the size of the input. For example, an algorithm that needs to create an array of size n to store the input will have O(n) <strong>space complexity</strong>.</p>
