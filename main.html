	<h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>So, the time complexity is the number of operations an algorithm performs to complete its task (considering that each operation takes the same amount of time). The algorithm that performs the task in the smallest number of operations is considered the most efficient one in terms of the time complexity.</p>
	<p><b>Space complexity </b>refers to the total amount of memory space used by an algorithm/program, including the space of input values for execution  <b>O(n)</b>. Calculate the space occupied by variables in an algorithm/program to determine <b>space complexity.</b></p>
